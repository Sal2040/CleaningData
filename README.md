# CleaningData
The scrtipt run_analysis.R creates an intermediary dataset from motion recognition data availbale at https://github.com/Sal2040/CleaningData and subsequently creates another dataset that only provides average values.

The majority of data manipulation is done using the dplyr package.

Detailed information on how the script works and what input data are used is to be found in the file codebook.md.
Further description and list of the input variables are to be found in the files features_info.txt and features.txt.


The final dataset is exported into the file cleanset.txt.
